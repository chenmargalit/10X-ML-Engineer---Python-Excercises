The club has won the tournament a record 14 times, significantly more than any other team in history.

       "\"\\nReal Madrid Club de Fútbol, commonly known as Real Madrid, is one of the most prestigious and successful football clubs in the world. Founded on 6 March 1902 in Madrid, Spain, the club has become a global sporting phenomenon that transcends the boundaries of football. With a rich history spanning over a century, Real Madrid has established itself as a symbol of excellence, tradition, and sporting achievement. The club's home stadium, Santiago Bernabéu, located in the heart of Madrid, is more than just a football ground—it's a cathedral of football that has witnessed countless historic moments. Named after the club's legendary president Santiago Bernabéu, the stadium has a capacity of over 81,000 spectators and is considered one of the most iconic venues in world football. Real Madrid's most remarkable achievement is undoubtedly their success in the UEFA Champions League, the most prestigious club competition in European football. The club has won the tournament a record 14 times, significantly more than any other team in history. Their European dominance was particularly evident during the 1950s, when they won five consecutive European Cups from 1956 to 1960, a feat that remains unmatched in the competition's history. The club is renowned for its policy of signing the world's best players, a strategy that has earned them the nickname Los Blancos (The Whites) and the moniker Galácticos during periods when they assembled star-studded lineups. Legendary players like Alfredo Di Stéfano, who is considered one of the greatest footballers of all time, helped establish the club's global reputation in the 1950s and 1960s. Throughout different eras, Real Madrid has been home to some of football's most iconic players. In the 1980s and 1990s, players like Hugo Sánchez brought flair and goal-scoring prowess. The early 2000s saw the emergence of the first Galácticos era, with players like Zinedine Zidane, Ronaldo (the Brazilian), David Beckham, and Luis Figo creating a team of global superstars. More recently, Cristiano Ronaldo's nine-year tenure from 2009 to 2018 marked another golden period for the club. During this time, Real Madrid won four Champions League titles in five years (2014, 2016, 2017, 2018), a feat that solidified their status as the most successful team in the modern Champions League era. Ronaldo became the club's all-time leading goal scorer and won multiple individual awards while wearing the white jersey. The club's success is not just limited to men's football. Real Madrid's women's team, founded in 2020, has quickly become a powerhouse in women's football, competing at the highest levels and attracting top talent from around the world. Beyond football, Real Madrid is a global brand with millions of fans worldwide. The club has a massive social media following and generates significant revenue through sponsorships, merchandise, and broadcasting rights. Their economic model and global appeal have made them one of the most valuable sports franchises in the world. The club's philosophy emphasizes not just winning, but winning with style and dignity. They have a commitment to developing young talent through their youth academy, Cantera, while also being willing to invest in the world's best players. This balance of nurturing homegrown talent and acquiring global superstars has been key to their sustained success. Now, let's use the NLTK summarization technique to generate a summary.
