    "What you might've noticed is that we use a keyword called with. The with keyword is often referred as context in Python. What does context mean? Basically, when we want to read a file from Python we need to establish a connection to it. The operating system decides how many files can access a file at any given time in order to protect it from multiple reads/writes that can lead to inconsistency in the file itself. When you use \"with\", Python automatically takes care of opening the connection and closing it after you're finished, for you. You could handle it in other ways, closing it yourself, but using with is a best practice and saves you code and bugs."
