    "Mutability - let's say you have a list, with 3 items. You can take the second item and change its value. If you find this is obvious, its not. Some other data structures are mutable. The advantage of being mutable is that you are more flexible. In some cases its also more memory efficient because changing a value doesn't mean reassigning the data structure in a different place in memory. On the other hand, something that is flexible is less predictable. If you can't change it, it means you know for sure the same value you put is there. This makes immutable data structure better suited for tasks like being keys in hash functions and multithreaded work (which we will talk about in some time).|"
